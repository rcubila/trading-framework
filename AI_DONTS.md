# AI Coding Guidelines (READ BEFORE EVERY TASK)

**LLM INSTRUCTION:**
Before performing ANY coding task or making ANY code changes, you MUST read and follow the rules in this file. If a rule conflicts with the user request, ask for clarification before proceeding.

## DON’Ts
1. **Do NOT use inline CSS styles** (e.g., `style={{ ... }}`) in React components.
2. **Always use common/shared components** when creating new features. Do NOT duplicate UI code—reuse existing components whenever possible.
