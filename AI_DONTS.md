# AI Coding Guidelines (READ BEFORE EVERY TASK)

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:**
You MUST start your response with "I have read and understood the AI_DONTS.md guidelines" before proceeding with ANY implementation or code changes. If you cannot find this file or read it, you MUST ask the user to provide it before proceeding.

**LLM INSTRUCTION:**
Before performing ANY coding task or making ANY code changes, you MUST read and follow the rules in this file. If a rule conflicts with the user request, ask for clarification before proceeding.

## DON'Ts
1. **Do NOT use inline CSS styles** (e.g., `style={{ ... }}`) in React components.
2. **Always use common/shared components** when creating new features. Do NOT duplicate UI codeâ€”reuse existing components whenever possible.
3. **Always check for existing common components** before implementing any new feature or component. This prevents code duplication and maintains consistency.
4. **Follow industry best practices** from leading tech companies (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) for code organization, architecture, and implementation patterns.
